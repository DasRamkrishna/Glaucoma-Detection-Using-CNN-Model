# Glaucoma-Detection-Using-CNN-Model
This project involves building a **Glaucoma Detection AI-ML model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify retinal images as either "Glaucoma Affected" or "Normal." The model is trained using **ImageDataGenerator** for data augmentation, with **binary cross-entropy** loss, **Adam optimizer**, and is saved in `.keras` format. The user can upload an image, and the model predicts glaucoma presence with a percentage, suggesting medical consultation if affected.

**IMPORTANT NOTE :** In the uploaded **Train** and **Validation** folder, here I only uploaded some sample photos. But in original you have uploaded as much photos as you can collect (only in .jpg/.jpeg) format. If i tell about mine, in actual i used more than 7000 photos for train and more than 1000 photos for validation for the better accuracy.
